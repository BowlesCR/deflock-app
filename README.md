# Flock Map App

A comprehensive Flutter app for mapping surveillance cameras to OpenStreetMap with professional offline capabilities, robust editing features, and an intuitive interface.

**Stop Flock** is a privacy-focused initiative to document the rapid expansion of automated license plate readers (ALPRs) and surveillance cameras. This app is the primary tool for contributors to map cameras in their communities and upload the data to OpenStreetMap, making surveillance infrastructure visible and searchable.

## What This App Does

- **Map surveillance cameras** with precise location, direction, and manufacturer details
- **Work completely offline** with downloadable map areas and camera data
- **Multiple map types** including satellite imagery from Google, Esri, Mapbox, and OpenStreetMap
- **Professional editing tools** to update existing camera locations and properties
- **Upload to OpenStreetMap** with OAuth2 integration (live or sandbox modes)
- **Built-in camera profiles** for Flock Safety, Motorola, Genetec, Leonardo, and other major manufacturers

## Key Features

### Map & Navigation
- **Multi-source tiles**: Switch between OpenStreetMap, Google Satellite, Esri imagery, and Mapbox
- **Offline-first design**: Download any region at any zoom level for complete offline operation
- **Smooth UX**: Intelligent zoom controls, follow-me mode with GPS rotation, and gesture-friendly interactions
- **Camera visualization**: Color-coded markers showing real cameras (blue), pending uploads (purple), and cameras being edited (orange)

### Camera Management
- **Comprehensive profiles**: Built-in profiles for major manufacturers (Flock, Motorola/Vigilant, Genetec, Leonardo/ELSAG, Neology) plus custom profile creation
- **Full editing capabilities**: Update location, direction, and tags of existing cameras with sophisticated conflict resolution
- **Direction visualization**: Interactive field-of-view cones showing camera viewing angles
- **Bulk operations**: Tag multiple cameras efficiently with profile-based workflows

### Professional Upload & Sync
- **OpenStreetMap integration**: Direct upload with full OAuth2 authentication
- **Upload modes**: Production OSM, testing sandbox, or simulate-only mode
- **Queue management**: Review, edit, retry, or cancel pending uploads
- **Changeset tracking**: Automatic grouping and commenting for organized contributions

### Offline Operations
- **Smart area downloads**: Automatically calculate tile counts and storage requirements
- **Camera caching**: Offline areas include camera data for complete functionality without network
- **Global base map**: Permanent worldwide coverage at low zoom levels
- **Robust downloads**: Exponential backoff, retry logic, and progress tracking for reliable area downloads

## Quick Start

1. **Install** the app on iOS or Android
2. **Enable location** and grant camera permissions  
3. **Choose a map type** from Settings â†’ Tile Providers
4. **Add your first camera**: Tap the + button, position the pin, set direction, select a profile
5. **Upload to OpenStreetMap**: Set up OAuth2 credentials in Settings and choose upload mode

## For Developers

### Architecture Highlights
- **Unified data provider**: All map tiles and camera data route through `MapDataProvider` with pluggable remote/local sources
- **Modular settings**: Each settings section is a separate widget for maintainability
- **State management**: Provider pattern with clean separation of concerns
- **Offline-first**: Network calls are optional; app functions fully offline with downloaded data

### Build Setup
**Prerequisites**: Flutter SDK, Xcode (iOS), Android Studio  
**OAuth Setup**: Register apps at [openstreetmap.org/oauth2](https://www.openstreetmap.org/oauth2/applications) and [OSM Sandbox](https://master.apis.dev.openstreetmap.org/oauth2/applications)

```shell
# Basic setup
flutter pub get
cp lib/keys.dart.example lib/keys.dart
# Add your OAuth2 client IDs to keys.dart

# iOS additional setup
cd ios && pod install

# Run
flutter run
```

## Roadmap

### Current Todo List
- **Performance**: 1000+ camera warning threshold for large datasets
- **UX Polish**: 
  - Fix "tiles loaded" indicator accuracy across different providers
  - Generic tile provider error messages (not always "OSM tiles slow")
  - Optional custom icons for camera profiles
- **Data Management**: Clean up cache when submitted changesets appear in Overpass results
- **Visual Improvements**: Upgrade camera marker design (considering nullplate's icon design)

### Future Features & Wishlist
- **Operator Profiles**: Additional tag sets for different surveillance operators
- **Announcement Mode**: Location-based notifications when approaching known cameras  
- **Enhanced Visualizations**:
  - Different colored rings for cameras missing specific tag details
  - iOS/Android native themes and dark mode support
- **Advanced Offline**:
  - "Cache accumulating" offline areas with size estimates per area
  - Offline areas as direct tile providers
- **Navigation & Search**:
  - Jump to location by coordinates, address, or POI name
  - Route planning that avoids surveillance cameras
- **Data Sources**: Custom camera providers and OSM/Overpass alternatives
