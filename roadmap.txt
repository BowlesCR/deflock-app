Needed:
- 1000 camera warning threshold
- website update
- "tiles loaded" when they objectively are not?
- "OSM tiles slow" when it's not OSM?
- optional icon for camera profiles
- improve marker - use nullplate's? https://github.com/FoggedLens/deflock/blob/master/webapp/public/map-icon.svg
- clean up the cache once submitted changesets appear in results from overpass

Future Features:
- operator profiles (addl tags that get set if selected)
- "announce" mode that says something when we're approaching a camera as a notification
- different color ring if only match generic profiles? (Missing tags indicator)
- iOS/Android themes? Dark mode at least?
- special "cache accumulating" offline area - maybe enable/disable, clear, selectable max zoom level? (Size estimate per sq. mi.)
- jump to location from by coords, address, POI name?
- Navigation, avoiding flock cameras
- custom camera providers; osm/overpass alternatives
- offline areas as a map tile provider??!?!?!11!!!  D=  !!  :D
